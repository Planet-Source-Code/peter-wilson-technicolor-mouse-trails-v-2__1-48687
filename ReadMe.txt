==================
Mouse Trails v1.1
==================
Simple mouse trails using recursion. Move the mouse over the form to display a colourful rainbow of colours that follow the mouse movement. Click the mouse button to change the Offset values. You'll enjoy this, if you like watching pretty colours dance about the screen.

Cheers,
